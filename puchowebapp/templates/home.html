                <p>It may sound cliche, (but so are some of the epic love stories), Pucho happened as a result of one of my most humbling experience in life. Hailing from the remote village of Madhubani, in the state of Bihar in India, my knowledge in English was deplorable. A simple task of filling up a form in English had become a hurdle for me - someone who aced almost every other subject in school and college. Fortunately, my English teacher back from school assisted me (along with giving a good dose of â€˜why havenâ€™t you learned English yet?â€™ speech). She is the one I have to thank for whatever English I learned thereafter.</p>

                <p>
                  I was just starting my career at the time, a young IT guy, loved coding, learning about latest technologies, always on the lookout for the value that would help me build something (I still didnâ€™t know what at that time) which would make information access free and available to all in their matra bhasha (native language). I eventually started learning about Artificial Intelligence, doing projects on Kaggle for MNCs and gradually I became an expert in the field and it was during this journey that the substance of Pucho formed - A platform that would revolutionize the way information was shared, consumed, created, and made available to those of us who havenâ€™t had the privilege of attending schools or learning, to those of us crippled by lack of â€œeducation in the right languageâ€�.

              <p>Pucho â€˜about Corona aims to reach out to the farthest corners possible and it believes strongly in a collaborative approach. Your voluntary participation is one of the key ways in which valuable and relevant information can be circulated in a range of locations. Each volunteer would themselves be a reliable resource person to many and they can spread the word even further through their networks. </p>

              <p>&ldquo;Spread of information actively needs its availability on different platforms and a positive affirmation in favour of its validity. Therefore, we at Pucho, are aspiring towards building up strong partnerships with PR agencies, Newspapers, Radio Channels and Television Partners.

To make Pucho â€˜bout Corona available on the web, smart phones as well as feature phones we need assistance from technology partners like cloud providers, GPU (academic institutions who have GPUs) and toll free number providers. We do not want any individual to miss out on the critical knit-grits about Covid-19 and therefore want to make ourselves well accessible and convenient.
