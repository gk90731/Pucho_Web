          <h3>Flagship Product</h3>
          <p class="mb-4">Pucho has embarked on a mission to eliminate the biggest language barrier problem in a country, where people have no access to online information and have no vernacular efficiency in English, English being the common online language. We endeavor to create a multilingual query and action platform on any device using text or voice.

â€˜Puchoâ€™, our flagship product â€“ is being built on a next-gen platform where queries can be made in any language either vocally or in text/video/image form and information will be available in voice, text, image or video form based on the type of query, in the language of the user. In essence, it will be a search engine that will provide you with knowledge not just from existing websites and online sources (like most search engines do) but also from offline sources, verified information from peers who are present on-ground in real-time.

Puchoâ€™s uniqueness lies in uniting the â€˜disconnectedâ€™ segment of our world.

          <h3>Pucho 'bout Corona</h3>
          <p class="mb-4">One of the most paramount questions that humanity has often come across is whether is it necessary to prioritize yourself over others even in times of crisis? Pucho believes, no. Not doing so and extending a hand to others around in times of catastrophe is where the cardinal essence of humanity lies. Today, the intensity of cataclysm has escalated to a degree which has imposed threat on all of mankind, a threat that nobody in the world ever imagined would become our reality, a threat that humans were not composed to accord with, and a threat that decrees unflinching and humane support of every being that exists at this point of time.
